# Welcome Macro

## Description:
### A script to write and send different custom messages depending on how many times a key is pressed in quick succession.

#### In this case, the key in question is right control.
#### The text after the `send` commands should contain the text you want to send when you press right control the respective number of times.
#### If you want to add more actions for more than 3 presses, it is easy to do so with minimal script modification.
#### There is also a check to make sure Discord is the active window. Note the title of the Discord window changes based on what channel you are currently in.
#### If the title of the window is not identical to `window_name` in the code, then nothing will happen, and right control key functions as normal.

Included in [releases](https://github.com/Malted-Wheaties/welcome-macro/releases) are pre-compiled binaries for the script as it is included in this repository. If you want to modify the script (which you probably will), you will need to download AutoHotKey and compile the modified script yourself.
